# Ethereum Tip Jar for Portfolio Website

## Overview

The Ethereum Tip Jar is a project integrated into a portfolio website, allowing visitors to send tips using Ethereum cryptocurrency. The project showcases a developer's ability to work with blockchain technology and create a practical application of decentralized transactions without implementing a custom smart contract.

## Features

- **Ethereum Integration:** Allows users to send tips using Ether directly from their wallets (e.g., MetaMask).
- **Web3.js Usage:** Utilizes Web3.js to connect the user's browser to the Ethereum blockchain and facilitate transactions.
- **Responsive UI:** A clean and minimalistic form for entering and submitting tip amounts.

## How It Works

The project uses Web3.js to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. When a user enters a tip amount and submits the form:

1. The app requests access to the user's Ethereum wallet through MetaMask.
2. The user approves the transaction, sending the specified amount of Ether to the developer's wallet address.

**Note:** No smart contract is used in this implementation. All transactions are directly handled through the Ethereum network.
